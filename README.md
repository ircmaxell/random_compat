Random Compat
=============

## What is this library?

This is a proof-of-concept (and potentially a compatibility library) for a simplified random number generation API to be proposed for PHP core for 5.6.

This library can generate strong random numbers and cryptographically secure random numbers.

## Usage

While the API is in flux, refer to `test.php` for example usage and the Random class itself under `lib`.
